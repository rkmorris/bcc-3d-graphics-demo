Simple 3D graphics demonstration program

Written from scratch in 1993/1994 by rkmorris using [Borland C++ 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_C%2B%2B) on [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS). Makes use
of the Borland Graphics Interface ([BGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Graphics_Interface)) using EGA/VGA graphic drivers.

Build instructions in [3d.c](https://github.com/rkmorris/bcc-3d-graphics-demo/blob/master/3D.C).

Features:
* Simple example of 3D graphics - translation of 3D coordinates into 2D
* Hidden surface removal
* Implements facet shading
* Perspective handling (commented out in this example)
* Choice of two models
* Easily portable to other platforms (low dependency on graphical capabilities)
